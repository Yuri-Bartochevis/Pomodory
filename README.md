distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = BR
ST = Provide your two letter state abbreviation
L = Provide the name of the city in which you are located
O = Provide a name for your organization
CN = Provide a name for the skill

[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth

```

now we need to generate .pem file.

```
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 \
            -key private-key.pem \
            -config configuration.cnf \
            -out certificate.pem
```
